            <h3 id="HTML">HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically describes the structure of a web page, how
                the page is going to look, details inside the page , it’s appearance.
                It is not a programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no logical coding
                required. The word hypertext means linking one web page with another webpage.
                Html has many tags such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;div&gt; and many more by which one can define a
                structure of their
                webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
                &lt;H1&gt; & &lt;h1&gt; works in a similar way.
                <br>
                Let us discuss a HTML tag:
                &lt;p&gt; This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML. &lt;/p&gt;
                So the output will be:
            <p> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML.</p>
            Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags do not require both opening and closing
            tags such as &lt;/br&gt; which can be used to break a new line.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 id="extension">EXTENSION (.html / .html)</h3>
            <p>
                The extension of html files is ".html" or ".htm". Since older versions of Windows only used three
                letters for an extension, this is why .htm but the newer browser accepts .html-based versions also. So,
                broadly speaking, the extension tells the browser that the file is an html file.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 id="structure">STRUTURE OF HTML</h3>
            <p>
                We can understand HTML’s web page structure using a tree data structure.
                Every tree has a root node, then it has 2 child nodes i.e. Left child node and right child node. Then
                each child of the root also has 2 child nodes and this structure continues. So in the case of HTML we
                can describe html as a root node and it has 2 child nodes which are the head and the body section. Then
                the head section also has child nodes such as title, links, scrips and many more. Similarly the body
                section also has child nodes such as script, image,p, div, ect.
                The structure of the webpage defines the flow of tags in which the web page will appear.
                <br>
                Below is a visual representation of html as a tree data structure.

        <li>
            <h3 id="compiler">COMPILER, INTERPRETER & HTMLPARSER</h3>
            <p>
                A compiler takes the entire program in one go. It generates an intermediate machine code. It is best
                suited for the production environment. The compiler used by programming languages such as C,C++, java,
                etc. It generates errors on compile time only. <br>
                Whereas an interpreter takes a single line of code at a time. It never produces an intermediate machine
                code. It is best suited for a software development environment. It is used by languages such as python,
                perl, ruby, etc <br>
                Parser or we can use HTMLParser for html. Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an
                internal format that a runtime environment can actually run.
                Initially when we open a html file in a browser, it converts the stream of characters into tokens and
                this process is called tokenization. Then after tokenization, nodes are created from the tokens. These
                nodes are then converted into a DOM i.e. document object model as a tree structure.
                <br>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 id="devtools">DEVELOPER TOOLS</h3>
            <p>
                So, basically developer tools are the modern tools provided by the web browser which are being used by
                the developer to test, debug, view source code of their website. The main task of developer tools can be
                that a person can open the developer tools and scroll to a particular section of a web page and there
                they can test, debug or change their design. <br>
                Similarly dev tools are being used to understand the structure of a web page or how the elements are
                being aligned over one another. We can use developer tools in almost all browsers. In google chrome we
                can enter developer tools section either by right click -> inspect, or by the shortcut key : Ctrl +
                Shift + I. <br>
                As developer tools we can also view the source code of any webpage by right click -> view source. In
                this way if we are not a developer of that webpage, then we can see the source code as how the developer
                has designed the page.

        <li>
            <h3 id="tags">HTML TAGS / ELEMENTS</h3>
            <p>So there are many many tags in html which have separate roles or work to do. For example an <image> tag
                    will let you add an image to your webpage or an <a> tag which is an anchor tag allows you to add
                        links to your webpage.
                        Let us take a tag and understand it’s syntax:
                        &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph tag. &lt;/p&gt;
                        There are 3 main parts: <br>
                        The opening tag: In case of an opening tag it consists of the tag within the angle brackets and
                        tells the browser that the particular rag is being started. In the above case &lt;p&gt; is the
                        opening
                        tag. <br>
                        The closing tag: In case of a closing tag,it tells the browser that the following tag is now
                        being closed and it is also between angle braces.
                        In the above example &lt;/p&gt; acts as a closing paragraph tag. <br>
                        The content: The content refers to the data which you are writing between the opening and
                        closing tags.
                        In the above example “This is a paragraph tag.” is the content.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 id="headings"> &lt;h&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The heading element refers to the heading of a paragraph or text written in big/bold letters. Heading is
                used to highlight important topics. Search engines use headings for indexing and structuring the content
                of a web page.
                There are 6 types of heading section elements from
                The heading element refers to the heading of a paragraph or text written in big/bold letters. Heading is
                used to highlight important topics. Search engines use headings for indexing and structuring the content
                of a web page.
                There are 6 types of heading section elements from
                &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, as &lt;h1&gt; being the largest and boldest and moving towards &lt;h6&gt;
                smallest.
                Ex:
            <h2> This is a type of h2 heading. </h2>


            </p>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <h3 id="anchor">ANCHOR &lt;a&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The anchor element is used to either create a hyperlink of other websites or create a hyperlink to mail
                or phone. It also has both opening and closing tags so the content between the &lt;a&gt; & &lt;/a&gt;
                can be
                displayed as a link and whenever a cursor points towards the links the user can redirect to the
                particular link or mail or phone.
                The anchor tag generally contains a href attribute in which we provide the link where we want to
                redirect the user if they click on it. The new link can open in the same tab or new tab/window depending
                upon the value of the target attribute. <br>
                Ex:
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">
                    Click here to visit the documentation on &lt;a&gt; element.
                </a>
            </p>
            <h4 id="urls">Absolute and Relative URL</h4>
            <p>
                Absolute urls are the url’s which contain every data related to the link or the anchored webpage /
                object. It consists of domain name, protocol , etc. Absolute urls are best for external website links or
                to prevent web scraping, disallowing duplicate contents such as the same url with or without http.
                Example of absolute url is : <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/target">Absolute URL </a>
                Relative urls are the urls which are mostly used for linking the internal files, webpages, images or
                other objects. So that the developers don't have to write the full address of the object instead
                they can just add the relative path of the object from their current object file. The relative path
                starts with the forward slash and leads the browser to stay within the current site. Relative url’s
                load faster as compared to absolute urls.
                Example of relative url: <a href="/log.txt">log.txt </a>

            </p>
            <h4 id="target_attribute">Target attribute</h4>
            <p>
                Target is an attribute of anchor tag by which we can decide and tell the browser where to open the link
                anchored. The target attribute can open a link in the same iframe, same window, same tab, different
                window/tab, different iframe, etc.
                Example of target: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/target"
                    target="_blank"> Click here to open mdn docs in the new tab. </a>
            </p>
            <h4 id="download_attribute">download attribute</h4>
            <p>The anchor tag has another very useful attribute known as download. Whenever we click on a link wrapped
                inside an anchor tag, it open up in a new page or same tab. But if we add the download attribute inside
                the anchor tag then it will pop up a dialog box and ask the user to save the file or object instead of
                opening it. The value we give in double quotes of download attribute takes the filename which we want to
                give user to save the file.
                Ex: <a href="images/myimage1.jpg" download="myimage2.jpg"> Click to download </a>
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 id="image"> IMAGE &lt;img&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The image element is used to embed the images in your web pages to make your webpage more interactive to
                users. The image element does not have a closing tag, instead the best practice suggests to use a “/” in
                the &lt;img&gt; tag.
                Image element has the following set of attributes such as src which takes either the url of the image
                (in case if the image is being taken from the internet) or the relative path (in case if the image is
                stored locally in your computer).
                Image element also have an attribute alt which is very useful in cases if a browser cannot load the
                image or the image is corrupted for some reasons then the text written in the alt attribute will be
                displayed instead of the image so the user gets the idea of what the image was all about.
                Html supports each type of image formats such as jpeg, png, svg, webp, etc.
                Ex:<br>
            <p align="center">
                <img src="images/myimage1.jpg" height="10%" width="10%" alt="Sunflower image" />
            </p>

            </p>
        </li>


        <li>
            <h3 id="table">TABLE &lt;table&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;table&gt; element is used to display data in a two-dimensional tabular way where the table
                contains rows and columns. Each cell in a row contains a data. A table is also used to quickly see
                relationships between 2 columns.
                There are many sub-elements in a
                &lt;table&gt; element such as &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;th&gt;,
                &lt;tbody&gt; , &lt;tb&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, etc.

            <h3 id="bold">BOLD &lt;b&gt; & STRONG &lt;strong&gt; ELEMENT</h3>
            <p>
                The html element &lt;b&gt; was used to make the content bold-face or you may say to bring the reader’s
                immediate attention to the bolded text. However the best practices suggest that we should use
                &lt;strong&gt; element instead of &lt;b&gt; element to bold the text. We can also use the font-weight
                attribute
                to increase the boldness of the text.
                Below is an example of both &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements. <br>
                <b> This is &lt;b&gt; element. </b> <br>
                <strong> This is &lt;strong&gt; element. </strong>

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 id="italic">EMPHASIS &lt;em&gt; ITALIC &lt;i&gt; ELEMENT</h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;i&gt; tag displays the text in italic. Like the &lt;b&gt; tag, the &lt;i&gt; tag is also used
                for presentation
                purposes. It represents some part of a text in an alternate voice or mood or something that
                indicates a different quality of text.
                The &lt;em&gt; tag specifies the stress emphasis of its contents. It can be used for changing the
                meaning of a sentence. The text within this tag is also displayed in italic.
                <br>
                For Example: <br> <i>This is &lt;i&gt; element.</i> <br>
                <em>This is &lt;em&gt; element.</em>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 id="spans">SPAN &lt;span&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>&lt;span&gt; element is a simple container tag which is used to contain elements on which we can apply a
                similar type of styling or javascript by giving the span an id or class. Span itself don't have any
                kind of properties and it have very similar features as of &lt;div&gt; unlike &lt;span&gt; is an inline
                display
                type of element. </p> <br>
            For ex: ```
            <span>
                <h5>This is Span Heading.</h5>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
            </span>```
            <span>
                <h5>This is Span Heading.</h5>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
            </span>

        <li>
            <h3 id="css">CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets which is a stylesheet language used to design out html pages or
                xml. It describes how the elements of html can be displayed / rendered on the screen to the user. We can
                change the properties of elements such as color, background color, font size, alignment, etc using css.
                CSS is included using the style attribute.
                <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4 id="inline_css">INLINE CSS</h4>
                    <p>Inline CSS is used to add css to a particular html element only. Inline css is not recommended if
                        our html code is large as it reduces the indexing. It is good only for small html codes.

                        <br>
                        Ex: <xmp>
                            <h5 style="color:red;"> Inline CSS </h5>
                        </xmp>
                    <h5 style="color:red;"> Inline CSS </h5>
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 id="internal_css">INTERNAL CSS</h4>
                    <p>

                        Instead of writing css everywhere in the html elements we can write whole css for the html file
                        under the head section using the style tags.
                        <br>Ex:

                    <p id="internal">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</p>

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 id="external_css">EXTERNAL CSS</h4>
                    <p>

                        The best practice of using CSS is by External CSS. In this case we make an additional CSS file
                        using a .css extension and then link this file to our html file using the
                        &lt;link&gt; element in the head section.
                        Ex: The Code in CSS File: <br>
                        <xmp>
                            .externalcss{
                            color: yellow;
                            }
                        </xmp>
                        <br>
                        The Code in HTML File: <br>
                        <xmp>
                            <p class="externalcss">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
                        </xmp>
                    <p class="externalcss">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 id="navigate">
                NAVIGATE FROM SECTIONS USING ID
            </h3>
            <p>
                We can navigate from one section to another of the same webpage by using
                <a> tag and using CSS ID’s.
                    Suppose we want to navigate to id “navigate” then we will create
                    an <a> tag by giving it the id in
                        the href attribute. <br>
                        Ex: <br>
                        <span id="navigate">This is navigated place.</span>
                        <br>
                        <a href="#navigate">Click here to navigate</a>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 id="lazy_loading">Lazy Loading</h3>
            <p>Lazy loading is used to achieve faster rendering of web pages. Nowadays the size of files and images have
                been increased. So the larger file size takes more time to get downloaded and rendered in the user’s
                browser. To remove this extra time we can use the concept of lazy loading where we can add the attribute
                loading and set it to lazy for images or iframes. This makes the page download faster and then the
                images may get downloaded when required. For example, if we take an example of an e-commerce website,
                then it’s home page has many sections such as cart, account, wallet, etc. But if we apply lazy loading
                then only the home page files gets downloaded initially not the whole web application, which saves
                user’s time and data.</p>

            Ex: 
            <br><center><img src="images/html tree structure.png" height="50%" width="50%" loading="lazy"></center>
        </li>
    </ul>
